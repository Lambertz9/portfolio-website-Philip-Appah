        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          RenewableZen is my first project as a UX Designer. It is a responsive web app that was delivered in fulfilment of certification in UX Immersion by CareerFoundry. I was motivated to embark on this project because it will offer energy
          solutions to a sizeable proportion of the society.
        </P>
      </div>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
          As a UX designer, my role was to apply a user-centred process to identify the problems, establish a hypothesis, conduct research, and come up with a design solution.
        </P>

        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Survey: Survey Monkey</li>
          <li>Sitemap: Flowmapp</li>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          It is complicated for individuals to find desired renewable energy experts in the field who will provide for them the needed amount of information to satisfy their preferential needs. There are insufficient direct and less bureaucratic
          mediums to connect with energy experts.
        </P>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that creating an app where users can conveniently search for an energy expert that is available upon request will go a long way to satisfying the needs of users.

        <div>
          <h2>02 Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            Understanding the app's key competitors helped in defining our audience. It also helped in identifying which of the competitors are doing a good job at solving user problems and which aren’t.
            Lapses were targeted and utilised as an advantage. Find below details of a competitive analysis performed on two expert seeking apps:

          <h2>User Survey</h2>
          <p>
            A survey was performed to gather understanding on how users think or feel (attitudinal) concerning the app. 5 survey goals were set to reflect the study purpose and help in administering appropriate questions. An example of a goal that
            was very helpful was “To ascertain the challenges that people encounter while gathering renewable energy information”. Find below details of the survey:

          <h2>User Interviews</h2>
          <p>
            I conducted user interviews (qualitative) to provide greater empathy assuming that the interviewees are prospective users and to gather substantial amount of data to compare the survey results with. A total number of 11 questions were
            asked. The Interview details are below:

        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          With a handful of mixed results, I needed to device a means to analyse the data and categorise them into informative quotes, behaviours, needs, goals, and frustrations for clear interpretation. I further categorised the information
          according to
          relationships by creating an affinity map. See affinity mapping below:

          <h2>User Persona</h2>
          <p>
            With gathered useful information and key insights from potential users, I was ready to develop user personas and user journeys that will represent the different user types that might make use of the app’s services. I designed two personas
            but one (Betina Anker) was chosen to represent this portfolio. See below:

          <h2>05 User Flow</h2>
          <p>
            After successfully drafting my user personas and journeys, user flow design was deemed fit to be drafted to avert design mistakes and to map out interaction steps from our users’ point of view. Here is Betina’s flow below:

          <h2>Sitemap</h2>
          <p>
            A sitemap was designed considering Betina Anker (user persona) after a close assessment of her story and flow. The sitemap was later iterated upon and refined after performing an open card sorting (OptimalSort) with 12 participants.

          <h2>Low-fidelity Wireframes</h2>
          <p>
            Upon outlining my sitemap, ideas about vital screens that would be needed to complete main tasks began to flow in. I made low-fidelity screens with free hand (pen and paper) applying the crazy 8 design exercise.  The screens below are
            some of the final paper sketches.

          <p>
            Creating a prototype from my high-fidelity wireframes allowed for a realtime observation of interactions while attempting to complete predefined tasks. To access the prototype (before UI Design) which was made via adobe XD click <a

          <h2>06 Usability Testing</h2>
          <p>
            I began the exercise by formulating my recruitment documents and consent forms. This was later followed by designing a Usability Test Plan and the Test Script.  Test goals and
            objectives were formulated and included in the usability test plan. The usability test goals are as follows: Examine if users are able to complete tasks, check users learnability, and to check convenient levels and durations of tasks
            completion.
          </P>

        <div>
          <h2>Usability Testing Results</h2>
          <p>
            Affinity Mapping was used to isolate the results and to identify patterns and hierarchies. On the Test Report, 5 of the errors were selected and prioritised according to their level of severity based on the Jacob Nelsons error scale (See
            graphic below). The full test report and Rainbow Spread Sheet can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cpJYlLnfA7tCwVGUDiG1kLy9gXf39jmH/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>

            Based on findings from the Usability Test exercise, the prioritised issues were fixed. The before and after screens below shows a rectification made based on one of the usability issues identified (users weren’t triggered by the “live
            chat” CTA on the expert’s screen), I changed the button to “book live chat”.

          <p>
            After careful readjustments of my prototype based on feedback from colleagues, I was ready to apply finishing touches (digital makeup) to my screens. I applied relevant UI principles such as the Gestalt principles and guidelines for
            accessibility. I also developed a Design Language System to guide the design of the product across multiple platforms and devices. Below are some screens of the final prototype. To access the full prototype on adobe XD click <a

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            The project being my first project ever as a UX Designer means a great deal to me especially how I was able to personalise the initial brief which was a general expert seeking app into an app to seek renewable energy experts. I was able
            to learn and adapt to the rudiments of UX Design and basic application of UI principles. I felt and still feel intrigued about how I was able to put together a design that isn’t only aesthetically pleasing but also convenient for users to
            execute defined tasks. I look forward to my next project, I am keen on improving on my design skills a bit a time.
