        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          This is a place for me to share with you my journey about becoming a natural but simple and eco-conscious UX designer. 
 
          Before my journey of UX began, I was focused on a research project which would help reshape Lagos, Nigeria into a sustainable city, the outcome was quite impactful. Although I proud of being an environmental manager, I felt that my creative
          capabilities were not being utilised to their full potential and that I could do more. 
 
          I put my thoughts into action towards the end of 2019 by taking a bold step of beginning a career path as a UX designer. Today, I am proud of that decision, I was able to merge my previous discipline (environmental resource management) into
          UX design by focusing on creating meaningful products and experiences that are environmentally friendly.

          My philosophy is to create and iterate on projects based on their true uniqueness. To go beyond mere design looks by making designs that
          offer real solutions.
        </P>
